This is a GUI application for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project built using Python and CustomTkinter. The application allows users to upload PDF documents, run a local LLM engine, and execute prompts to get answers.

## Features

- Upload PDF documents for processing.
- Execute prompts against the LLM and receive answers.
- Start the Docker engine directly from the GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Docker

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Required Packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the rag_gui.py file from the path pathway\llm-app\examples\pipelines\demo-question-answering.


## Instruction:
Ensure Docker is running in the background before starting the application. The LLM engine will only work if the Docker engine is active.
